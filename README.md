# Equity-App

Welcome to the home of the app associated with the paper *Visualizing inequities: A step toward equitable student outcomes*!

If you'd like to explore the tool we've built, you can view an example online at https://rbpotter.shinyapps.io/Equity-App/ (code for the website is in **Website.R**).

Running **App.R** in RStudio will allow you to locally build the shiny app we discuss in the paper, so that you can apply it to your own data! (The layout of this app is quite similar to the website except we have added the feature of authentication.)

As-is, the app uses the provided template data **Template_Inequities_In_Course_Performance_Cleaned.csv** (adapted, modified, and further anonymized from [Harris 2020](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aaz5687). But you can use the provided data as a template and manipulate your data to be in a similar format before replacing our template with your data. We have more advice on how to do this in our paper. 

Those are the main files that may be relevant to you! We store images for our website in the **images** folder and the **rsconnect** folder helps us handle the deployment of the website.

We hope you find this tool useful!
